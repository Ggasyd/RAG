# chat with your pdfs
This project aims to implement a chatbot that responds to all your questions based on a PDF provided by the user. The chatbot uses the Databricks dolly-v2-3b model and the FAISS library for Retrieval Augmented Generation.

## Local Project
Once the project is cloned locally, use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the necessary libraries for the project to function properly. Then you just have to execute the `rag.py` file and you will have access to a simple graphical interface created with Gradio.
